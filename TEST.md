The Glass Menagerie – Learning and The Art -- Betty Ding - My Nguyen

1.  The most important element of The Glass Menagerie is the
    conversation between the characters about their education
    and manners.

2.  Each of the conversation vaguely implies the wisdom they want
    to convey. For example, in page 14 Amanda said (3). Through that
    sentence it shows us the conflict of the mother when the plans she
    came up with for her children failed. There’s clearly a
    misunderstanding between what the children really want, and what
    their mother wants. Amanda did not realize this until the moment of
    the sentence.

3.  Here are the snippets that show the wisdom of the characters.

(1) P5 Tom said” I am the narrator of the play, and also a character
    in it. The other characters are my mother, Amanda, and my sister,
    Laura, and a gentlemen caller who appears in the final scenes. He is
    the most realistic character in the play, being an emissary from a
    world of reality that we were somehow set apart from. But since I
    have a poet's weakness for symbols, I am using this character as a
    symbol; he is the long-delayed but always expected something that we
    live for. “

(2) P12 Amanda said"What are we going to do, what is going to become of
    us, what is the future?".

(3) P14 Amanda said" Oh! I felt so weak I could barely keep on my feet!
    I had to sit down while they got me a glass of water! Fifty dollars’
    tuition, all of our plans – my hopes and ambitions for you – just
    gone up the spout, just gone up the spout like that."

(4) P61 Tom : Yes, movies! Look at them – \[a wave toward the marvels of
    Grand Avenue\] All of those glamorous people having adventures –
    hogging it all …

(5) P59: Jim said” In public speaking! You and me, we’re not the
    warehouse type. …”
